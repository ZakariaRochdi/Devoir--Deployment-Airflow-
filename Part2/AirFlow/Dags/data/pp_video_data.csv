One of my favourite AI tools is definitely Claude by Anthropic.

What I love the most about Claude is its personality. When I ask it questions, it provides thoughtful opinions rather than just affirming what I want to hear. It also asks me deeper and better questions that make me think more about how I could solve a problem.

I use Claude more as a thought buddy, for example when I’m wrestling through any business or life problems, Claude is my go-to conversational partner.","['Ali Abdaal', 'Ali abdal']",2025-12-10 09:00:44+00:00,2169.0,184.0,,5.0,PT1M6S,hd,False,Wednesday,0 days 00:01:06,27

TgKWKzrbMnc,Ali Abdaal,Why I Was Scared To Quit My Job For YouTube,"As a doctor, I was wired to avoid failure at all costs.
After all a mistake could literally kill someone.
The mindset of avoiding failure in medicine saved lives.

So I had to learn to:
➡️ Follow protocols exactly
➡️ Always have backup plans
➡️ Never take unnecessary risks

But that same instinct almost cost me my dreams.

For years, people asked me: “Why don’t you quit medicine and go full-time on YouTube?”

I had every reason to:
➡️ My YouTube channel was growing
➡️ I enjoyed it more than clinical work
➡️ The business potential was obvious

But I couldn’t pull the trigger. Why?

Fear of failure 😨

💸 What if I lose my savings?
📲 What if the algorithm changes?
🏠 What if I end up homeless and broke?

But writing my fears on paper changed everything 📝

Not keeping them in my brain. Actually writing them down.

And I asked specific questions:
✍🏼 What’s the absolute worst that could happen?
✍🏼 How likely is it to actually happen?
✍🏼 Would it actually be permanent?
✍🏼 What could I do to prevent it?

Turns out, I could start a business with $0.
I could test things as experiments.
And the worst case scenario wasn’t death.

It was just going back to being a doctor.
Which, honestly, wasn’t even that bad.

If fear’s got you stuck, don’t try solving it in your head.
Your brain will lie to you.
Make it concrete.
Write it down.","['Ali Abdaal', 'Ali abdal']",2025-11-15 10:00:58+00:00,39716.0,300.0,,2.0,PT8S,hd,False,Saturday,0 days 00:00:08,27
DskHY3xG9X0,Ali Abdaal,How to make time for everything,"It’s quite hard for me to find free time now.

But a few years ago, I worked as a doctor in the UK and I built my business on the side. The key that helped me manage my time was an automated 168-hour spreadsheet I created: https://go.aliabdaal.com/168spreadsheetyts

If I had to start again, I’d use the same spreadsheet again and here’s what I’d do 👇🏼

1️⃣ Audit Your Time Expenses.

Most people think they don’t have time, but the truth is they’ve never actually measured where their time goes.

An average person’s week looks like this:

😴 Sleep: 56 hours (8 hours/night)
💻 Work: 52 hours (commute, lunch, prep)
🍔 Food: 12-15 hours (cooking, eating, groceries)
🧹 Chores: 12 hours (cleaning, laundry, errands)
📺 Entertainment: 30 hours (TV + social media)

Most of the 168 hours are already exhausted. Before kids. Before goals. Before side projects.

2️⃣ Strategic Sacrifice.

Most productivity advice fails, as it assumes you can cheat maths. You can’t. You have to sacrifice. I made 3 trade-offs while working as a doctor.

❌ Firstly, I spent zero time watching TV. The only exception was social watching with friends.This freed up 15 hrs/week.

🍱 Secondly, I lived off takeaway meals only. Skipped breakfast entirely for years. And never set foot in grocery stores. This is not a lifestyle I’d recommend to everyone. This cut my food time to just 2-3 hours a week.

🧽 Thirdly, I outsourced cleaning. I’d get my flat cleaned every other week and this saved another roughly 10 hours a week.

3️⃣ Double-Dip Your Dead Time.

The final unlock was utilising “dead” time.

For example, my 2-hour daily commute.
➡️ I listened to business podcasts at 2x speed.

My lunch breaks at hospitals.
➡️ I scripted my YouTube videos if I had some time.

This added another 10+ productive hours weekly.

Result: 31 hrs/week of free time while working full-time as a doctor.

Most people at the time thought I was really productive.

But in reality, there are physically not enough hours in the week to do all the things you want to do.

It just comes down to what you’re willing to sacrifice.","['Ali Abdaal', 'Ali abdal']",2025-11-14 10:00:26+00:00,83150.0,483.0,,12.0,PT3S,hd,False,Friday,0 days 00:00:03,27

Hey friends, finding your “purpose” isn’t something you stumble on. Instead, it’s something you build through small, honest experiments. In this video, I chat with Joe Hudson, who is the not-so-secret CEO coach to many big companies you may know of. He shares counterintuitive insights and a simple 5‑step roadmap to audit your life, solve the money worry creatively, and move with less self‑criticism so you can feel purposeful right now. Hope you get something out of this conversation xx

Hey friends, in this video I’m walking you through my entire AI workflow as an entrepreneur, from how I capture ideas with tools like VoicePal and SuperWhisper, to how Claude processes all of that, and how everything comes together to Notion, Google Docs, and more. I’ll also show you exactly how I use these tools across my three main businesses (content creation, online education, and software) to save time, think better, and build faster. This video is sponsored by Anthropic, but we did approach them because my team and I use Claude every day. Hope you enjoy xx

Hey friends, this video is about how to change your life in just four hours using something I call a Think Day. It’s inspired by Bill Gates’ “Think Week,” where he credited some of Microsoft’s biggest breakthroughs to taking time away just to think. I’ll walk you through how I run my own Think Day here in Hong Kong, the prompts I use, and why I believe the quality of our decisions really does dictate the quality of our lives. Hope you enjoy xx

Hey friends, in this special Freedom Fridays episode, I'm sharing what I've learned about financial freedom after nearly two decades online: the real skills you need, why luck is a myth, and the exact frameworks that helped me and my students make money on our own terms. This one's a bit different since I filmed it during a live workshop in London, but I wanted to share the lessons with you. Enjoy x

Hey friends, someone recently asked me for my single best piece of advice for their twenties, and I surprised both of us with my answer: audiobooks. In this video, I explain why making audiobooks a weekly ritual could transform your life, whatever your goals. Hope you enjoy xx

Also, this video isn't sponsored by Audible lol, I've just been an Audible fanboy since like 2017 and it's changed my life. I don't even have an Audible affiliate link. There are of course, other Audiobook platforms - Apple, Speechify, and a few other players. Use whatever you want. Or don't. Up to you :) Thanks for watching, either way xx

Hey friends, today marks my eighth year on YouTube. Yep, I’ve now officially been a YouTuber longer than I was a doctor, which is as weird for me to say as it is for you to hear. In this video, I’m sharing the honest lessons and unexpected identity shifts that come from trading scrubs for scripts, and what eight years of making videos has really taught me about creativity, career pivots, and finding your thing (even if you never had a plan). Hope you enjoy xx

Hey friends, welcome to the first episode of Freedom Fridays, a new series where we get into the nitty-gritty of what school never taught us: how to actually build financial and time freedom. In this kickoff, I’m sharing the real reason behind launching this series and telling the (sometimes messy) story of how I started chasing freedom in the first place. If you’ve ever wondered how to live life on your own terms, this one’s for you. Hope you enjoy xx

Hey friends, if you’ve ever found yourself lost in an endless scroll, convinced that one more article or video will finally unlock your big idea, this one’s for you. In this video, I unpack why consuming more isn’t the answer, and how shifting to creation mode is the only way you’ll actually stumble onto the things that matter (and maybe even what you’re meant to do).

Hey friends, in this video, I’m sharing how I’ve been using AI as a kind of life coach. It’s surprisingly good at asking questions that spark reflection and clarity, especially when I prompt it the right way. I’ll walk you through the exact prompts I use to get deeper insights, how I get the AI to push back (even scathingly), and how I think about AI’s insights. Hope you enjoy xx

I used to get hit with writer’s block constantly. Now, I’m VoicePalling my ideas: I grab my phone, go for a walk, and let VoicePal capture my thoughts while I get my steps in.

There’s something about being outdoors that just makes ideas flow easier. Walking, breathing fresh air, taking in the surroundings—it’s not about ‘writing’ anymore, but just talking through my ideas. Then VoicePal turns it all into a first draft that actually sounds like me.

If you’re ready to try a new way of ‘writing’ that feels more like a walk in the park (literally), search VoicePal on the App Store or Play Store :)

0-KLzTzLk0E,Ali Abdaal,VoicePal - a ghostwriter in your pocket 👻,"I used to struggle to find time to write. Running a team, making videos, and doing podcasts meant I had all these ideas, but staring at a blank screen just didn’t work. I even thought about hiring a ghostwriter, but that would’ve cost me $5K a month 😳

That’s why my team and I built VoicePal—a ghostwriter in your pocket. Now, I just talk through my ideas while walking, and the app turns them into a first draft that sounds like me.

I’ve been using it daily for my videos, newsletters, and even my next book. It’s a total game-changer! 🚀

Hey friends, so this is a 3 hour evidence-based studying course that I filmed a few years ago and put on Skillshare, but now I want to make it available to everyone for free. In this class, I'll take you through the well-kept secrets of how to study effectively and organise your workflow to be ready for exams when they come around. We'll also discuss why studying effectively and efficiently is one of the best ways to maintain a work-life balance. 

We'll break down (1) how to understand our content using techniques like the Feynman Method, Active Recall and various note-taking strategies, (2) how to remember our material with Spaced Repetition, Interleaving and various memory techniques, and (3) how to maintain focus while studying, from developing the motivation and discipline to do the work, to taking appropriate breaks and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Hey friends, in this video I talk about one of the best books I read last year called The Pathless Path by Paul Millerd. I absolutely loved it and I think you will too. It's a freeing book to read and reminds us that there is more to life than work and fulfilling societal expectations. If you're having any kind of career struggles, I definitely recommend checking it out. Enjoy x

In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my YouTube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2022. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account and please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty. Enjoy x

IyPsEF511Vw,Ali Abdaal,"Brandon Sanderson on Writing, Storytelling and Fantasy Books","Brandon Sanderson (@BrandSanderson) is my favourite author of all time. He writes incredible fantasy books, including Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive, and wrote the final 3 books of The Wheel of Time. Brandon's output is legendary - he writes books almost faster than we can read them, and he teaches creative writing at Brigham Young University.

If you want to make money on YouTube, you'll need to be ready to play the long game. My channel didn't start to make money until roughly 85 videos and nine months in. If I'd quit 84 videos in, the last five years would have never happened. 

In this video, I look at the three lessons I've learnt about turning a personal brand into a business and answer the top questions I'm asked about monetisation on YouTube. 

If you want to use the tool that's helped me optimise my YouTube channel, sign up to VidIQ here - https://vidiq.com/aliabdaal

ELavuz3btaE,Ali Abdaal,How to Make Productivity More Fun,"My main philosophy for being more productive is simply to have fun, even when you're doing the smaller boring tasks.

The whole point of a productivity system is to get your life in order and free up valuable brain space. No one wants to be spending tons of time organising emails or searching for a book quote that they forgot to highlight. 

There are broadly three levels of building an ultimate productivity system: keeping your life in order, capturing new info, and creating a system around it. You can stop at layer one or use all three. I cover it all in more detail in this video, including suggestions for apps that I like to use daily.

So what is the perfect productive skincare routine? There are zillions of skincare products out there, from avocado face masks to LED therapy and snail-slime face creams.

One of the most annoying problems I face in my life is information overwhelm. I read all these books, listen to podcasts and watch YouTube videos and don't feel like I'm taking anything away from what I'm consuming. That is until I came across the concept of the second brain what we'll be discussing in this episode of 'Book Club' with Tiago Forte's 'Building a Second Brain'.

ngWZaSbw130,Ali Abdaal,Why Buying Is Not Always Better Than Renting,"So you've probably heard the phrase ""renting is money down the drain"" and you've probably been told your whole life, that you should get on the property ladder and buy a home, because once you've bought a home, then you're saving money and it's an investment and stuff, and hey, at least you're not renting anymore and throwing all that money away. 

BUT it's actually a lot more complicated than that. BOTH buying and renting have costs, both financial and psychological, and those are the factors we need to take into account which I'll be discussing in this episode of Money Club.

These lessons have helped to change my outlook and attitudes to time management and are super useful to learn early on in your journey to being more productive and living a more meaningful life.

In this video you’ll get an in-depth look under the hood of my digital setup. Productivity is about using our time intentionally and effectively: over the years I’ve refined this system to help me run multiple businesses, grow a YouTube channel, start a podcast, and write a book. In a previous life it also helped me graduate from medical school, and still get things done while working as a doctor.

I’ve had this nagging feeling that I’m due an upgrade on my trusty Bose 700 noise-cancelling headphones, which I’ve had for a while. So I bought the 5 best ANC headphones on the market (and one cheap one), and put them head-to-head in this review.

In this video, I'll be going over all the iPad models out there in 2022 and which would be the best to buy right now as a consumer, creator or professional.

My upfront conclusion is that if you're a consumer/student then the basic iPad is your best friend. If you're a light creator then you should probably go with the iPad Air (2022, M1) and if you're a creator / professional of some kind, then the iPad Pro (11"" & 12.9"") is for you.

Hey friends, in this video, we're taking a quick look at Amazon's newly released Kindles and which one I recommend you buy for 2022! Upfront, my conclusion is that you should go for the Paperwhite, but the standard kindle is also pretty good and much cheaper, it just comes with a few compromises. The Signature and Oasis are both pretty ridiculous unless you have money to burn or a very niche use-case. Hopefully this video helps with your decision! Enjoy xx

In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my YouTube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2021. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account and please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty.

PS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it goes into a company account which I then pay 21 team members, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions etc. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this ""top line business revenue"" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :)

So I've been agonising about this for a few months now, and I think I'm at a point where I can comfortably say that I'm leaving medicine for good. In this video we're going to have a bit of a chat about the thought process behind this decision, and I'll share my thoughts around the main fears that I had after investing 8 years of time and money into it. Maybe I'll change my mind and come back one day...who knows?!

I never used to be a huge fan of goals. They just seemed a bit pointless compared to the value of a robust system. But over the past year speaking to different experts, I've come to realise that there may be more to this whole goal thing than I previously thought.

In this ridiculously long and detailed video, I'll take you behind-the-scenes of my Youtube channel and various businesses to show how much money we've made in 2020. Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account. And please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty. 

PS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it all goes into a company account. Then I pay salaries for 2.5 full time employees, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this ""top line business revenue"" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :)

i6jjc9tfwt8,Ali Abdaal,Think Like a Monk - @jayshetty - Summary + Key Points,"In this episode of book club we're looking at the best selling book Think Like A Monk by @Jay Shettywhich looks at how we can learn to overcome negative thoughts and habits, and access the purpose that lies within us by learning to think more like monks. In the video, we look at the three key areas that Jay identifies as key to this process - Letting Go, Growing and Giving - and why, in our hectic modern world, it is more important than ever to find ways of managing our thoughts to reduce stress, improve focus, and offer our service to the world.

In this episode of book club we're looking at the best selling book The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday which looks at how we use the ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism to help us turn adversity to our advantage. In the video, we look at the three key areas that Ryan identifies as key to this process - Perception, Action and Will - and discuss some examples of people who have successfully overcome adversity by leveraging the hidden benefits of obstacles to their advantage.

Hey friends, I'm pleased to bring you my latest SkillShare class that's being released today - How to Be Happier - A Stoicism Masterclass. I've taken great value from some of the principles of Stoicism over the past few years and so I decided to get together with my friend Sam, who is an expert on the ancient Greek philosophy, to put together this class. Over the course of 12 lessons, we explore the key themes of Stoicism as well as explain how to apply Stoic principles to your own life to foster happier and healthier lives as a result. I really hope you enjoy it!

In this video we're unboxing and taking a first look at the new Microsoft Surface Go 2 tablet, along with a few of its accessories. I bought the base $400 model with the Pentium processor (because the proper M processor was out of stock). This is not intended to be a comprehensive review by any means, just an unboxing and first look. Enjoy xx

In this episode of Book Club we're talking about Atomic Habits by James Clear. We look at the power of 1% change, the importance of adopting better systems rather than setting goals, the need to focus on identity rather than outcomes and, ultimately, how to build better habits through the 4 laws of behavioural change. Enjoy!

In the first episode of Book Club - a series where we take an in-depth look at a particular book every fortnight - we're talking about The Unfair Advantage by Ash Ali and Hasan Kubba. We look at the equation for success, the MILES framework for identifying our Unfair Advantages, the value of understanding our Unfair Advantages, how everyone has their own Unfair Advantages and the importance of a reality-growth mindset running throughout it all. Enjoy!

Giving What We Can: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/

“I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.” #TakeThePledge #GivingWhatWeCan

In this video, we're taking a look at the method that my friend Osaid used to rank 1st at Cambridge University Medical School. He was consistently in the top 3 overall, and ranked 1st in several subjects using this method. It involves taking Active Recall to its logical extreme (the most efficient study technique, backed by decades of evidence).

In this video, I talk through 10 tips that I picked up while building and running a business through medical school. My company 6med (https://6med.co.uk) does around £150,000 in annual revenue and was built by me and my friends while we were medical students at Cambridge University. We talk about the importance of not waiting for permission, standing on the shoulders of giants, learning to code and design, working with friends, starting small, doing things that don't scale, expecting and learning from failure, starting with why, but above all, just starting. Enjoy!

🎬 My FREE online course on video editing - https://skl.sh/32TpEvm

If you've dreamed of starting a YouTube channel but haven't got an expensive camera and gear yet, this video's for you. We talk over my top tips for filming quality videos with your iPhone / Android using the app Filmic Pro. The audio is probably the most important part - I'd highly recommend using the Rode VideoMicro to start with, and you can always graduate to an external audio setup (like I have) later on. Good luck with your journey!

In this video, I'm addressing lots of assumptions that you guys sent in via Instagram. Lots of the comments were about money and relationships, but there were a few about how I'm going bald, how arrogant I come across in videos and how I probably went to private school. For the record, my feelings weren't at all hurt by these, it was just banter, so please don't feel bad for me. Enjoy xx

In this video, we're talking about the setup that makes my YouTube videos. We go through the camera, lens and monitor, and the lighting and audio equipment that makes my videos look pretty reasonable in terms of quality (if I do say so myself). I also give a quick tour of my desk and the stuff that's in the background. Enjoy xx

In this video, I discuss the 4 main ways in which I use my iPad Pro in my daily work as a junior doctor. I talk about (1) how I use Goodnotes and the Dash Plus Productivity System to manage my to-do lists, (2) the magic of electronic medical records, (3) the power of being able to look stuff up on the fly, and (4) the beauty of productive downtime. Enjoy xx

PS: Eagle-eyed viewers might realise that this is a re-upload. The original video I posted in early 2019 missed the mark in terms of taking issues like data protection seriously. I hope this new version addresses some of those issues while also showing what a benefit technology like the iPad provides in clinical settings.

This is a quick video review of the iPad Mini (2019). I talk about why I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for students - for various reasons, I think the iPad Air or iPad are better purchases. However, if you're just using the Mini for content consumption, then it's perfect. Enjoy xx

In this video, we're taking a quick look at Amazon's latest Kindle (2019) and comparing it to the 2018 Kindle Paperwhite. As I say right at the start, it's no contest - if you're in the market for a Kindle, you should get the Paperwhite and totally ignore the Kindle. Enjoy xx

In today's Tech Tuesdays, we discuss recommendations for which iPad is best for which people. I conclude that the iPad Mini is best for those who use an iPad for purely consumption purposes, but if you're a student, or if you use it for any creative purposes, you'd probably be best served with the iPad Air (2019). 

If you're on a tight budget, the iPad ($319) is a pretty solid shout, and if you have a tonne of spare cash to burn, you can't get much better than the iPad Pro.

This is the first proper 'study with me' video of the new season. If you're new to the series, I'll be documenting my process of preparing for the MRCOG, a postgraduate medical speciality exam for Obstetrics and Gynaecology. In this video, I take you through a day off work where I spent some time 'scoping the subject' - ie: going through the specification and organising my Evernote and Notability notebooks into a reasonable structure. We end with a lovely evening of board games and food, courtesy of Just Eat, who are very kindly sponsoring the video. Enjoy xx

In this interview, I talk to Anton, a 6th year medical student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Anton got 4 rejections the first time he applied, but he tactically worked on his application and got an offer from Cambridge University after taking a gap year. In this video, Anton addresses a load of questions that you’ll hopefully find helpful if you’re reapplying to medicine.

We recommend the cheaper iPad for the majority of students, and then discuss some of the differences in the user experience (using the Apple Pencil) in more detail. We end with a discussion about pricing, and I share my personal reasons for choosing the iPad Pro over the standard iPad. Enjoy xx

Slightly different episode from the usual today. A little while ago, I spent a few days in Grenada, an island in the Caribbean. On one of the days, I visited St George's University, a medical school in the capital city to experience life as a medical student in Grenada. I had a wonderful time being shown around by an old friend, and got some pretty sweet shots of the beautiful island. Enjoy xx

In this video, we talk about my strategy for taking notes with the iPad and Apple Pencil. I use an iPad Pro but would probably recommend the new 2018 iPad with Apple Pencil if you're buying a new one. We talk about the benefits of taking notes with an iPad vs traditional methods, we talk about Notability vs OneNote (I prefer Notability), and I share various techniques of note-taking that I use in lectures, seminars and hospital placements.

tBANvzdbY_s,Ali Abdaal,We Just Can’t Wait to Begin - The Prion King | Addenbrooke’s Hospital Pantomime 2018,"THE ADDENBROOKE’S PANTOMIME

Each year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed “The Prion King” and raised over £10,000 for the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. 

It follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. 

Each year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It’s always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we’re putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!

SONG #2 - WE JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BEGIN

The second song introduces our main cast of ‘good guys’ - Simbastatin, Naloxone, Cornelius, Shelly and Minnie, as well as a load of other students all placed on the same ward in the hospital. The students are filled with naive joy about what life in clinical school is like, and expect they’ll be saving lives as an integral part of the clinical team on a daily basis. This song is a culmination of their continued optimism.

OTHER SONGS:

1. Another day of fun (La La Land) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-QC4mT8bXA
2. We just can’t wait to begin (The Lion King) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBANvzdbY_s

LYRICS:

[NALA] Clinical school’s finally here,
The day we’ve waited for 
[SIMBA] It’s gonna rule that much is clear
Preclin was such a bore

[SIMBA] I bet this is a piece of cake, 
The wards sound like a laugh,
[RAFIKI] Just wait until you’re an F1
We’re always understaffed

[ALL] Lectures prepared us for anything
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!

[MINNIE] Ordering blood tests
([SHELLY] what was that dear?)
[NALA] Analysing CTs
([SIMBA] what are they?)
[CORNELIUS] chatting up patients
([ZAZUSAN] excuse me?)
[S, N, M, C, Sh] It’ll be a bre--eze
([ZAZU] now see here!)

[S, N, M, C, Sh] Always finish by midday
([ZAZU] A patient a day keeps failure--(interrupted))
[S, N, M, C, Sh] We’ll have so much time to play

[CORNELIUS] (arm over Nala) I wonder if on my first day I’ll break a patient’s heart
[NALA] First you’d need a bath and sort that smell out for a start

[DOCTOR] (surrounded by ridiculous number of students) If this is where our hospital 
Is headed, count me out!
I hate students
And Savannahbrooke’s 
There’s private work about!!

[ZAZU] (flaps after her) We’re sending half the students to King’s Lynn!
[ALL] Oh we just can’t wait to begin!

[Sh+C] Learning on the ward rounds
[MINNIE] Helping run the clinics
[SIMBA] Acting in the theatres (everyone stares at him)
[NALA] Simba you are so thick (friendly)

[ALL] We’re finally meeting patients what a dream
Consultants will all want us on their team
We’re gonna save so many lives, you’ll see
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!
Oh we just can’t wait to begin!

06:57 - Exams are a month away. Any last minute tips, what you’d be doing?
10:55 - Any tips on how to learn content quickly? Exams are a month away and we haven’t even finished some of our courses yet.

14:21 - How should I use active recall? Do past papers count. 
14:46 - If you have Anki why do you still use your spreadsheet method? Surely you can do all that stuff on Anki with custom decks and filters and stuff. How do you decide what goes on Anki and what goes on Google Sheets?

In today's episode of 'Life as a Cambridge medic', we go through a sunny day on GP placement. I talk about some of the patients I saw, we do a quick tour of our cottage, and get some pretty reasonable drone shots of the Norfolk coastline. Enjoy xx

G-QC4mT8bXA,Ali Abdaal,Another Day of Fun (La La Land) - The Prion King | Addenbrooke’s Hospital Pantomime 2018,"THE ADDENBROOKE’S PANTOMIME

Each year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed “The Prion King” and raised over £10,000 for the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. 

It follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. 

Each year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It’s always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we’re putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!

SONG #1 - ANOTHER DAY OF FUN

The opening number shows the new 4th year clinical students arriving in Savannahbrooke’s Hospital and trying to navigate their new environment. They’ve spent the past 3 years of preclinical medicine practically living in the library, but are about to meet real patients for the first time. Filled with blind optimism, they burst into La La Land-inspired song. It’s another day of fun.

LYRICS:
(Explanations in footnotes)

We’re back for our first day
We’re going to start clinical school
Patients better pray
We are so excited, but we still don’t have a clue
No one has told us what to do
We wish we knew [1]

Summer’s at an end
These CPC’s [2] are going to 
Drive me around the bend,
And my placement plan [3]
Just seems so random and bizarre, 
I think I’m gonna need a car
King’s Lynn [4] is way too far!

Hope my GP’s somewhere near [5]
Is he even in our year?
Not sure what I’m doing here
We’ll have to see

What the hell’s the GMC? [6]
Are they friend or foe to me?
Where do I find my ward? 
Do I have to go in?!

In hospital
Always have to run
So we find everyone with signs [7]                                                                                                            
Why’d I live in town? [8]
(It’s another day of fun)
I’m always late and now
(It’s another day of fun)
This lanyard’s going brown
And it’s another day of fun!

Climb Hills Road
We reach Savannahbrooke’s [9]
We’ll find everyone with signs
But can it fit us all? [10]
(It’s another day of fun)
Do-we have to do on calls?
(It’s another day of fun)
Can we still drink at all?
Oh it’s another day of fun!

LYRICS EXPLANATIONS:

[1] General comment about how clinical school (Years 4-6) is a totally different experience to undergrad (Years 1-3) and so everyone’s unsure as to what’s going on
[2] CPC = Clinical Pathological Conference. Most of our 2-hour clinical pathology lectures take this format, with a panel of experts from various specialities related to the topic (eg: radiology, histopathology, respiratory etc)
[3] Reference to ‘placements’ where we get sent off for 6 weeks at a time to various hospitals around the East Anglia region.
[4] Kings Lynn is famously the furthest away (1h30m drive from Cambridge), and so it’s fashionable to complain about it.
[5] We also get sent off on GP placements, some of which can be up to 2h30m drive away from Cambridge. If you’re unlucky and get put somewhere far away and don’t have a car, you might have to travel for up to 4 hours on public transport to get there…
[6] GMC = General Medical Council. 
[7] “Signs” refers to physical attributes that some patients might have when you examine them. For example, a “distended abdomen” is a 
[8] Addenbrooke’s hospital is around 2 miles from Cambridge town centre. Students living in town (as opposed to further out) have a ~20 minute cycle to get there each morning.
[9] “Savannahbrooke’s” is where our pantomime is set. It’s a magical world where all the doctors and patients are animas, hence all the face paint. 
[10] One of the running gags in this year’s pantomime was the increased intake of clinical students, prompting jokes about capacity issues.

In this video, we talk about what to do if you don't get any offers for Medicine, or if you don't make your offers. It's a tricky and difficult position to be in, but we can't change what's happened, so it's important to look to the future and figure out an action plan.

In today's episode, we learn how to save lives in the Immediate Life Support course run by the Resuscitation Council UK. This was a super useful day on our Emergency Medicine placement. After the course finished, some of the junior doctors run a teaching session for us in the doctors' mess, and we finish the day with a game of Pandemic Legacy and some excellent home-cooked food. Enjoy xx

My mum, brother and I spent 5 days in Iceland over the Christmas holidays. We were based in Reykjavik and took day trips to various locations around Iceland, attempting to get some cool-looking shots with our cameras and learning how to fly a drone (DJI Mavic Pro). Enjoy xx

In this video, we'll be discussing some of the ethical and legal issues raised by the case of Charlie Gard. Charlie (4 August 2016 – 28 July 2017) was born with a rare, incurable and life-limiting disease called MDDS. His case became controversial because the medical team and parents disagreed about whether experimental treatment was in Charlie's best interests. 

Abi and I are 6th year medical students at Cambridge University, and in this video we've tried to introduce you to some of the issues that Charlie's case brought up. We've made every effort to check our facts, and have referenced a number of useful resources (that we ourselves used) below. If we've made any mistakes, or if you disagree with our analyses, please do comment below - we'd love to learn from you.

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

Content Note - Candid discussions about suicide and euthanasia.

In this video, we take a look at the ethics and law behind family- and physician-assisted suicide. We start with a discussion about family-assisted suicide, and introduce 3 well-known cases that helped shape or illustrate the UK's law around it. We then discuss Lord Falconer's (failed) Assisted Dying bill briefly, before turning to a discussion of the arguments for/against legalising physician-assisted suicide (euthanasia). 

As I mention in the 'future' segment around 00:48, the stuff about family-assisted suicide, and the cases of Diane Pretty, Debbie Purdy and Daniel James, are probably well outside the scope of what you 'need to know' for medicine interviews. If you're just here for some focused medicine interview prep (and there's nothing wrong with that), you'll get the most value from the final 10 minutes of the video starting at 16:50. But if you're interested in the topic generally, then hopefully you'll find the entirety of the video enlightening.

TIMESTAMPS:

16:50 - The ethics of euthanasia / assisted suicide - This is the most important and relevant bit for medicine interviews. The rest is for general interest mostly, and probably not directly helpful for interviews.

As promised, here's the long-awaited video about my 2018 university desk setup. I use it for work (I'm a medical student in case you haven't heard), video editing, web design and development (www.6med.co.uk), watching stuff on the internet and pretty much everything else. 

This is something I've wanted to do for a while, but doesn't neatly fit into the usual 'medicine application advice' or 'life of a medical student vlog' that the rest of my videos fall under.

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

In this video, we discuss the legal side of euthanasia/physician assisted suicide. To summarise - euthanasia is illegal in the UK. 'Passive euthanasia' is a confusing term which we should avoid. 'Withdrawing medical treatment' is good medical practice when done appropriately, and is NOT the same thing as 'euthanasia'. 

Throughout the video we talk through the case of Dr Cox and Lillian Boyes which illustrates a lot of these points and is pretty seminal as far as legal cases go.

CORRECTIONS:

In Re T (Jehovah’s witness case) it was the refusal that was deemed invalid, not the original consent (Molly said that the consent was found invalid). 

And in the case of Nigel Cox, he was found guilty of attempted murder, not of manslaughter as we say (at 12.48). 

Profound apologies for the inaccuracies, and many thanks to Dr Fistein from the Cambridge Clinical School faculty for pointing out the errors.

This episode of The Vlog is loosely based around a day preparing for the Situational Judgment Test (SJT). We roam a little around Cambridge with camera in-hand, do a group revision session at a friend's house, meet with a Consultant transplant surgeon to discuss an app idea, and end with a trip to the ADC Theatre to see the Cambridge University Show Choir performing. Enjoy xx

PS: Chronologically, these events happen between episode 17 and 18. I've changed up the order a bit because I wanted the Christmas-themed videos to come out around Christmas time :)

In today's episode, we're supposed to be preparing for our finals, but instead end up singing some carols at the local hospital, filming some videos about medical ethics and being recognised by a medicine applicant in a restaurant. Enjoy xx

Interview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. 

This video covers the basics (and some advanced stuff) about how to answer medical ethics scenarios. We're deliberately giving you more than you 'need to know', because hopefully if you're watching this video, you want to stand out in your medicine interviews rather than scraping by :) 

We discuss a medical ethics scenario that I got in my Imperial interview, using the 4 principles approach. We then expand on those a bit, giving you some tidbits that you can throw into your medical ethics answers to get brownie points with your interviewers. Finally, we end with a discussion of where the 4 principles of ethics actually come from, briefly explaining the meaning of virtue ethics, deontology and utilitarianism.

Towards the end of this video, I talk about a patient who died that evening. The team tried resuscitation, but were sadly unsuccessful. 

Most of my videos about 'life as a medical student' paint quite a positive, almost airbrushed picture of what it's like.

However, given the number of medicine applicants who seem to be watching these videos, it seems unfair to only offer the rose-tinted view. 

As such, I won't be shying away from the heavier issues like death and dying that we, as medical professionals, are immensely privileged to be a part of. I hope to be able to talk about them in a sensitive manner, and hope that you'll see these segments in an educational and reflective light.

CLOSING THOUGHTS - 

Being part of the team that evening was a privilege that I'll never forget.

Our patient got the best possible care, but sadly, wasn't able to be resuscitated.

Death is an unavoidable part of being a doctor (and indeed, of being human). But too often, we're afraid of it, reluctant to talk about it with patients and families. 

I'm sure, over the course of my career, I'll meet many more patients who will die. I hope to learn from each, and to share some of that experience with you. 

My thoughts and prayers are with our patient and her family. May she rest in peace.

This episode focuses on our 3-day adventure at SWMUK (Students Wilderness Medicine UK), a conference for medical students and paramedics interested in expedition/wilderness/mountain medicine. We camped out in some random field in Nottingham for 2 nights, attended some inspiring talks and workshops, and had a generally great time. 

This whole wilderness medicine thing is something I'd never imagined myself wanting to do, until I got involved with CUWMS (Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society) in 4th year. Now I think I'd really like to explore this avenue of medicine further, and as such, this conference was a really eye-opening experience.

This video tackles 9 questions that you sent in about the Oxford / Cambridge medicine interview. Timestamps to everything below, so feel free to click through to get the most out of it, or alternatively, watch the whole video for a solid 22 minutes of me talking about the Oxford/Cambridge medicine interview. Enjoy xx

Question 2, 3 and 8 are relevant to all medicine interviews and MMIs, not just Oxbridge. The rest of the questions are quite Oxbridge-specific, but loads more videos coming soon about non-Oxbridge interview prep :

TIMESTAMPS:

1. Should I learn all my A2 Biology and Chemistry? 00:45
2. In how much detail do you need to know stuff in your personal statement? 02:46
3. What counts as 'recent news'? 04:43
4. What if they ask about a topic you haven't done yet? 06:27
5. Do Oxbridge consider 'Mental Health' to be scientific? 08:03

If you're thinking of applying to Cambridge (or Oxford) for Medicine, you might find this video useful :)

We talk about 5 questions to ask yourself to work out whether you'd enjoy the style of learning at Cambridge, and then talk a bit about concerns people have about the Cambridge 'stereotype' (whatever that means to you).

NB: Oxford and Cambridge are very very similar, so everything in this video also applies to Oxford. The course at Oxford is also very academic, and the stereotypes equally apply (if not more so).

A random day of Senior Medicine placement, where we go to the gym, hang out on the wards, have a teaching session, realise we're addicted to Everwing (a Facebook messenger game) and play Pandemic (an awesome board game). Today was pretty representative of a 'standard' day on placement, which made it tricky to turn into a hopefully-entertaining video.

Part II of our wilderness medicine expedition with the Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society (CUWMS). We kick things off with a nighttime medical emergency at the campsite, followed by a quick debrief, and then an artsy montage of the final day of trekking around the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park.

The wilderness medicine trips will definitely be one aspect of Cambridge medical student life that I'll miss the most when it's over. These vlogs will hopefully be a way to relive the wonder one day when we're all jaded from the grind of doctor life.

Huge thanks again to everyone who went on the trip - you guys were awesome :)

A trip to Yorkshire Dales National Park with the Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society (CUWMS). Each term, we do a couple of trips to various pretty parts of the UK. We spend the weekend hiking through mountains, doing the occasional medical scenario, eat lots of food and play lots of group bonding games like Mafia, Articulate and more. 

Massive thanks to everyone who went on the trip for (a) being awesome and friendly and lovely, and (b) being cool with a fat camera pointed at their face for a lot of it. Love you guys xx

In this video, we're taking a deep dive into section 3. We start by talking about space and scoring, and then talk about how to tackle the 30 minute-long paper. Planning is by far the most important part.

We end with some thoughts about how to prepare for BMAT Section 3, including whether you should read extra books, and how many timed essays to practice.
