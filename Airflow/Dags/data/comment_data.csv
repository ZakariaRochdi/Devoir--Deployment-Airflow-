Whether with sound or color, it’s the same awareness exploring itself through different mediums.\n\nNothing in this universe happens in isolation. From a higher view, Sheeran’s creative shift is not a change, but a continuation of a divine, preorchestrated unfolding.

Jump between different tasks or aspects of the project depending on your mood and motivation [06:29], [07:23].\n * The Horizon Habit: Instead of setting rigid, specific goals that might be outside your control, set general, directional ""horizon goals"" that allow for flexibility in how you achieve your aspirations [09:02], [09:20].\n * The Piano Precedent: While planning is helpful, be prepared for unexpected events that might disrupt your plans. Life rarely follows a perfectly linear path [10:22], [11:15].\n * The 100-Year Old Plan: When facing a decision, imagine what your 100-year-old self would advise you to do. This helps prioritize long-term values over short-term urgencies [11:35], [11:59].\n * The Purposeful Approach: Productivity isn\'t just about work or business; it\'s about efficiently doing the things that allow you to spend more time on what truly matters to you, including ""soft goals"" that bring you meaning and fulfillment [13:03], [13:41].', 'Thank you so much sir ❤', 'Wish I could meet u one day !! ❤', 'Great video.

However, they likely did not explain why they made that statement. There are countless reasons why everyone cannot become a writer. You asked, ""Then why are we all here?"" Well, you were there to gain knowledge and develop comprehension skills in several subjects—not just writing—in pursuit of your goals. Not everyone\'s goal is to become a writer. Moreover, you were also in school because the law (truancy policies) required it; otherwise, your parents could face a judge explaining why you were not attending. \n\nYou were there to learn how to write, among other subjects, but not necessarily to ""become a writer."" If everyone could become a writer, why do so many people struggle with it? I have heard people say they used tools from videos, but nothing worked. Additionally, I’ve read comments from people on YouTube who followed advice from creators, only to have their writings rejected. \n\nLet me share a couple of abridged examples from my experience. My teachers always complimented my writing. As a child and later a teenager, those compliments meant little to me because, in my naïve and dismissive mind, ""everyone writes."" I would shrug it off and move on. Then came the SAT, where I scored very high, nearly reaching the maximum score, with my writing section achieving the top score. In college, my professors often praised my writing, inviting me to join the college newspaper and sit on editorial panels. Despite receiving invitations to join various organizations, including the International Honor Society, I still didn’t realize the significance of my writing ability. \n\nSo, what didn’t I get? Keep reading. I became a teacher and passed the writing portion of the teacher certification exam with a perfect score. Later, I was assigned to teach student teachers who had failed the writing portion of the exam. After working with me, they all passed. Yet, it wasn’t until graduate school that I truly began to understand my gift. I graduated with double majors and the only 4.0 GPA in my program—still unaware that graduate school revolves heavily around writing and being published. After turning in my final writing assignment, research study, and manual, my professor wrote her farewell as my professor and referred to me as Author Gail Becker. \n\nIf it had not been for that professor, I would not have become a writer, nor would I be teaching my students and elderly clients how to write their memoirs. \n\nIt took me years to realize I had both the gift and talent for writing. Despite all the compliments I received, I never considered becoming a writer because it wasn’t one of my three original goals: acting, modeling, or teaching. While I achieved those goals, I eventually embraced writing. \n\nSo, while some may have a natural propensity for writing, not everyone can or will become a writer. Always remember: if everyone could, then everyone would.']"

The problem was, if I wasn’t confident I could complete a task or accomplish a goal, I often wouldn’t start at all.  \n\nThe turning point came when I redefined success. Instead of measuring it by the end result, I began seeing success in every step: *I succeed when I start. I succeed when I complete even the smallest step.*  \n\nNow, my default mindset isn’t about the final outcome but about making progress, one small step at a time. This shift has eliminated my procrastination, and even when I do slip, I can get back on track within minutes.  \n\nThat’s why, although books on procrastination do a great job of explaining its causes and providing motivation, they don’t offer much practical help—at least not for me.']"

I knew what I wanted to do from the age of 13. Now, I'm 45 and I currently operate a career change that sometimes makes me feel that I lost my North Star ✨ but I do it anyway (even imperfectly...)I also know deep inside that it is the right thing to do, it's just that I can't see or experience the things that would make me feel super self-confident, from where I stand right now. I haven't read the book 📚 yet but by experience I'll say that achieving dreams, not only goals, developing a strong sense of self, of humour as well as personal values that will nurture your sense of humanity and empathy, plus making amazing memories (travels, healthy and diverse social life, deep intercultural conversation, intellectual curiosity, speaking more than 1 language etc.\nplus I've never been drunk or tried any kind of drug) early in your adult life make very much of a difference down the road 🛣️🛣️🛣️ I feel the benefit of it every single day. It changes your perspective on happiness, personal development and so much more... A lot of things that the majority of people think are impossible to achieve (happiness, self-actualisation....) are actually very achievable. Happiness at the bottom line relies on your hormonal system so, there is no way it couldn't be achievable.... Almost everything in life is a matter of perspective that allows the experiences, the experiences allow the beliefs, the beliefs allow systematic cognitive behaviours plus also personal values etc. etc..... Well, you know what I mean. Whenever you start understanding a bit how things work, then Life becomes easier and easier... I'd add that curing, healing that inherited systematic sense of contradiction is critical. I've seen people along the way doing and achieving an astonishing amount of right things (healthy lifestyle, yoga, volunteering, financial freedom, beauty etc.) BUT behind all possible closed doors they would contradict those things systematically because of nasty and hidden personal values (but still very real)and the belief systems they relie on, therefore that...systematically diminished their sense of humanity.... I can tell you without a doubt that they will never be happy nor self-actualized. FACT. I've learnt about contradiction in Philosophy classes back in highschool, my prof always said you should never contradict yourself in any possible way (like not only verbally but also in your values, behaviour....) and it sticks magnetically with me. It's been 2 decades now and I can see how much he was right about that. I'm not out of the woods yet 😂😂 and I struggled with a few things in Life, money is one of them. I still have work to do and things to figure out but I'm close enough to believe that there is a way and a right way to believe and do things if you want to live the human experience to its fullest...

The book broke down how real wealth moves in silence- through trusts, paper losses, and controlled chaos. I realized I’d been building a business. He’d been building a fortress.', 'Halfway through How the Elite Print Their Wealth, I realized something: this wasn’t written for people like me. It was written by someone who walked the halls of private equity firms, trust law offices, and offshore banking conferences- and decided to blow the whistle. That’s what it feels like. A quiet whistleblow. It doesn’t just explain wealth… it unlocks the operating system behind it. If this book ever goes viral, I wouldn’t be surprised if it quietly disappears.', 'I used to walk around angry, thinking the system was broken, rigged, unfair. But after reading How the Elite Print Their Wealth, I realized- the system works exactly as designed. I just wasn’t invited to understand it. That book showed me how wealth is quietly created through legal structures, debt, and time- not labor. It was like someone turned on the lights in a room I didn’t know I was in. Nothing about how I see money, taxes, or “income” has been the same since.', 'I was reviewing a partnership agreement for a real estate deal and something about the structure felt off- like the profits were invisible but the control was absolute. My attorney said, “This is family office-level structuring.” I didn’t even know what that meant until I read How the Elite Print Their Wealth. Suddenly that contract made sense. It wasn’t about owning- it was about positioning. I realized the rich don’t win by being on the front lines. They win by being above the battlefield entirely.', 'I was on a long-haul flight from Zürich next to an older guy who didn’t talk until the final hour. We started chatting about wealth, and I mentioned how I felt like I was always “catching up.” He said, “You’re trying to earn wealth. The elite print it.” Then he gave me a title: How the Elite Print Their Wealth. That single sentence, and that book, made me rethink everything: income, structure, ownership, exposure. Now I don’t hustle harder. I just design smarter. The game didn’t change- I did.', 'I’ve read a lot of business books. Some inspire. Some educate. But How the Elite Print Their Wealth? It rewired me. It didn’t just teach me new tactics- it made me realize I was using the wrong operating system. Since reading it, I’ve set up a holding company, shifted how I pay myself, and legally cut my tax exposure in half. I don’t “grind” anymore. I architect. Total life pivot- and it started with a single book I randomly saw mentioned in a comment section.', 'I ordered it on Amazon and currently waiting for it to arrive.

Both outcomes matter.', '2:25:\n\nI tried verifying his claim saying that ""97% of night shift workers DO NOT adapt to the demands of working at night"", but 4 sources said that it\'s not entirely acurrate to say that.\n\nOpus 4.1 Thinking with Search says:\nNight shift workers do partially adapt to working at night, but research shows this adaptation is typically incomplete and comes with significant challenges.\r\nPartial Adaptation Occurs\r\nThe human body can shift its circadian rhythms to some degree when exposed to consistent night work schedules. Workers who maintain the same night schedule for weeks or months show measurable changes in their melatonin production timing, core body temperature rhythms, and alertness patterns. Performance and alertness during night hours generally improve after several consecutive night shifts.\r\nWhy Complete Adaptation Rarely Happens\r\nSeveral factors prevent full adaptation to night work:\r\nBiological constraints: Our circadian system evolved to align with natural light-dark cycles. Even with artificial light manipulation, the body\'s master clock in the brain strongly resists complete inversion of its natural rhythm.\r\nSocial and environmental conflicts: Most night workers revert to daytime schedules on days off to participate in family and social activities. This constant switching between schedules prevents stable adaptation. Daylight exposure during commutes home and light leaking into bedrooms during daytime sleep further disrupts adjustment.\r\nIndividual variation: Some people adapt better than others due to genetic differences in circadian clock genes. ""Night owls"" typically fare better than ""morning larks"" on night shifts, but even they rarely achieve complete adaptation.\r\nHealth Consequences Persist\r\nStudies consistently show that even experienced night shift workers who feel they\'ve adapted still experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, digestive issues, and mood disturbances compared to day workers. Cognitive performance, particularly for complex tasks requiring sustained attention, often remains impaired during night hours even after years of night work.\r\nThe evidence suggests that while humans can partially adjust to night work, our bodies never fully overcome the fundamental misalignment between our internal biological clock and working against the natural light-dark cycle.\n\nGrok 3 says:\nThe idea that night shift workers don\'t adapt to working at night isn\'t entirely accurate, but there\'s a kernel of truth to it. Humans are biologically wired for diurnal activity—our circadian rhythms, driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, naturally align with a 24-hour cycle of daylight and darkness. This means that for most people, working at night goes against their internal clock, making adaptation challenging.\r\nThat said, adaptation is possible to varying degrees. Some night shift workers can partially adjust their circadian rhythms through consistent schedules, controlled light exposure (e.g., avoiding blue light during ""daytime"" sleep hours and using bright light during work hours), and other behavioral strategies. However, complete adaptation is rare. Studies, like those from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), show that even long-term night workers often experience ""circadian misalignment,"" leading to issues like sleep deprivation, fatigue, and increased risk of health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\r\nOn the flip side, individual differences play a huge role. Some people—often called ""night owls"" due to genetic predispositions (e.g., variations in the PER3 gene)—are naturally more suited to late hours and may adapt better than early birds forced into night shifts. Age also matters; younger workers tend to adjust more easily than older ones due to greater flexibility in sleep patterns.\r\nSo, while many night shift workers struggle to fully adapt, it\'s not a universal rule. The human body is stubborn about its daylight preferences, but with the right strategies or inherent traits, some can make it work—though often at a cost to long-term health if not managed carefully. If you\'re curious about specific coping mechanisms or health data, I can dig deeper into those!\n\nAI Overview in Google Search says:\n\nThe claim that 97% of night shift workers don\'t adapt is a specific statistic that is not supported by available research. While it\'s difficult to fully adapt to night shifts because they go against our innate circadian rhythms, studies show that many workers struggle with sleep quality and experience various health issues. Instead of a fixed percentage, the research indicates that circadian disruption is a common challenge, leading to difficulties in sleep, increased health risks, and negative impacts on well-being. \r\nWhy Adapting Is Difficult\r\nPhysiological Clocks: The human body is naturally wired to be awake during the day and sleep at night, driven by light-dark cycles. \r\nCircadian Rhythm Resistance: The central clock in the body is resistant to adapting to a day-oriented schedule to a night-oriented one. This means that even with consistent night shifts, the body struggles to fully realign its sleep-wake cycle. \r\nQuality vs. Quantity: Workers may get enough sleep in terms of hours, but the quality of that sleep is often poor, leading to ongoing fatigue. \r\nConsequences of Poor Adaptation\r\nHealth Issues: Shift work can increase the risk of metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. \r\nMental Health: Social isolation and other factors can contribute to concerns for mental health among shift workers. \r\nPerformance: Difficulties with sleep and wakefulness lead to impaired performance and increased risks of accidents. \r\nWhat Helps\r\nSleep Environment: Using blackout curtains, eye masks, and earplugs to block out light and noise can help improve daytime sleep quality. \r\nConsistency: While not a perfect solution, trying to maintain a consistent sleep schedule can be beneficial. \r\nSupplements and Aids: Melatonin supplements and sleep aids may provide temporary relief for some individuals. \r\n\n\n\nAI Mode from Google says:\nThe figure that 97% of night shift workers don\'t adapt is not substantiated by medical research and may come from anecdotal claims found on forums like Reddit. Scientific studies show that most people have difficulty fully adapting to night work, but the inability to adapt is not as universal as 97% suggests. \r\nMedical research on shift work points to the following issues, which confirm that full adaptation is not a common experience: \r\nCircadian misalignment: The body\'s internal clock is very resistant to shifting to a nocturnal schedule, even for permanent night workers. For those who switch to a day schedule on their days off, the body\'s rhythms are in a state of constant ""roller-coaster swings"".\r\nPersistent health risks: Working against the natural circadian rhythm increases the risk of numerous health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and gastrointestinal disorders.\r\nSleep disruption: The most significant challenge is sleep disturbance. Night workers experience poor-quality, fragmented, and insufficient sleep, which leads to chronic sleep deprivation and fatigue.\r\nVaried individual tolerance: The ability to cope with shift work varies from person to person. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more sensitive to sleep loss and circadian disruption. One estimate suggests that about 20% of workers who attempt shift work are unable to tolerate it. \r\nIn summary, while the 97% figure is an exaggeration, it is a fact that the vast majority of night shift workers struggle with the health and sleep demands of their schedule. The challenges are so significant that many never fully adjust, even if they manage to continue working the shift. \n\nSo uh...', 'I tried meditation for other reasons a while back.

Blind people can develop enhanced hearing and spatial memory.  Deaf people become hyper-sensitive to facial expression and body-language.  Emotionally 'interrupted' people adapt also.  As Gabor Maté describes, trauma is a self-preserving behaviour that made sense eat the time of actual challenge (abuse or neglect), but has out-lived it's usefulness and, in fact, is now a burden.  It is interesting that, if my father burst my eardrums and deafened me after smacking me in the side of the head, when I was a child, I would be treated as an actual casualty, with sympathetic treatment, accommodation and rights as befits a 'disabled' person.  However, if my father only broke my mind with his hands, the resulting dysfunction would be regarded as a burden on humanity, I would be isolated as 'difficult' or 'complex' if I didn't seek therapy or I would be shunned as weak and compromised, if I DID seek therapy.  However, broken minds need drugs, healthcare, entertainment, prisons, excessive food and drink, materialism, serial marriages etc; i.e. misery is a boundless and fruitful market."", ""Well, I wouldn't say the Q&A-format of the book is novel.

But why wait to learn from your own experience while you can pick the lessons from other people’s experiences? Well, if you are like me, then you know making money is awesome. Spending it is way gratifying. However, with poor management, your hard-earned money can be flushed down the drain with only one snap of a finger. After intensive research, I discovered that money is a game of numbers, and if calculated well, you get to enjoy its benefits. Money can either be a slave or a master. A rule of thumb: If you bleed money more that you make, then you are a slave to money. However, if you make more money than you spend, then money becomes your slave. \r\n\r\n“What is done cannot be undone, but at least one can keep it from happening again.”-Anne Frank.

I literally flew halfway across the world for this collaboration and it was totally worth it. \n\nNow that the video is live, I want to provide some more color about why people should get started as online writers, regardless of whether they want to eventually start a blog or a YouTube channel. \n\n1. Attract friends and business partners: It\'s hard to meet people as passionate about learning as you are. But when you publish your ideas, you attract people who think like you. The more niche the topic, the easier it is to attract people on your intellectual wavelength.\n\n2. Writing helps you understand yourself. All of us have unprocessed feelings and emotions. Writing is the best way to identify what\'s making you uncomfortable. By writing, you gain clarity in your life. The increased clarity you receive reduces stress and anxiety in your life.\n\n3. Writing accelerates your learning: If you want to understand a topic better, start teaching it. The act of putting ideas into your own words tattoos them into your mind. As James Clear once said: ""If you think you can learn a lot by reading a book, try writing one.""\n\n4. Writing makes you more observant: Whenever you write something, new parts of the world come alive. Every experience, every conversation, and everything you read becomes a potential future sentence. That\'s why writing regularly wakes you up and makes your mind come alive.\n\n5. Writing establishes expertise: Excellent essays attract excellent people. If you write well about a topic, the world\'s experts will reach out to you. Since writing is a record of your best ideas, your essays will double as a resume that demonstrates your intellectual rigor.\n\n6. Writing will accelerate your career: Good writers are clear thinkers and clear thinkers are rewarded at work. By writing, you can gain outsized influence in your company and establish yourself as an industry expert, which will attract opportunities.\n\n7. Writing attracts opportunities: Every article you publish is like a serendipity vehicle. High-level people who resonate with your ideas will reach out to you with career opportunities you couldn\'t have imagined. Thus, writing maximizes your surface area of exposure to luck.\n\n8. Writing improves your thinking: Mathematicians put their ideas on the whiteboard because writing out your ideas lets you tackle harder problems. Writing is the same. By putting ideas onto the page, you can transcend the limits of scattered thinking and explore ideas deeply.\n\n9. Writing online forces you to think better: Thinking in public raises your standard for quality. When I was a kid, our house was always cleanest when guests would come over. The same is true for writing. You think better when you know you\'re going to be seen and critiqued.\n\nFinally, I think it\'s worth answering one more question: Why is now the time to write?\n\nIt\'s never been easier for average people to share their ideas. If you write well, your ideas will find their way to some of the smartest and most successful people in the world. As your reputation grows, so will the opportunities available to you.\n\nWriting regularly is one of the best habits you can build. \n\nIf you want to learn the craft of online writing, sign up for my free 50-day email course: https://dperell.com/50-days-of-writing', '5:04 😂, man talking at 10x speed', 'It’s kinda wild how people are only scratching the surface and don’t take the time to read 25 money secrets from Donald Trump.

I bought a Brygde keyboard for it and it is wonderful. I just wish I had ordered the one with the trackpad. Oh well.\nThe 11” will be given to family.', 'The video compares the iPad Pro 11-inch and 12.9-inch models, discussing portability, capability, and psychological impact. The speaker used the 11-inch daily for years and initially preferred its portability, particularly for carrying around in hospitals. However, after using the 12.9-inch model, they decided to switch.\r\n\r\n### Key Points:\r\n1. **Portability**: The 11-inch is more portable, but the 12.9-inch is still manageable and not significantly harder to carry.\r\n2. **Capability**: The larger 12.9-inch screen enhances multitasking, making tasks like taking notes and working with split screens easier and more enjoyable.\r\n3. **Psychology**: The 12.9-inch feels more like a “work” device compared to the 11-inch, which felt closer to a phone, leading to increased productivity.\r\n\r\nOverall, while the 11-inch is great for portability, the speaker now prefers the 12.9-inch for its better screen and increased productivity, making it worth the upgrade. For students, the speaker still recommends the iPad Air unless they have a strong reason to choose the Pro models.', 'Generally to me the 11 inch should be a perfect fit for people who are on the go, and the 12.9 is for someone who has it permanently on their desks. As a engineer who goes to site often, i had used the 12.9 and it was cumbersome and heavy which ruins the mood of notetaking on site.\n\nSwitching to 11 inch model was way more portable and easier for me and got me to achieve more things done while on the go.\n\nOf course above is my opinion but just someone that uses both sizes before and is what i feel.', 'I love the way you answer things so fully.

However, it takes the same amount of time, if not more (because you need to rephrase the content as a question which needs time), to write those questions and much much longer time to review those questions...So I eventually gave up. \nThe method I use now is to just randomly find a test banks online of the subject you study then do it before the exams. It doesn't have to be your textbook, any free test banks that from the same subject is fine, because: 1) 90% profs know students use test banks, so they don't use them in exams anymore (unless they are lazy or treat teaching as a chore to finish) so no need to waste time or money to get the exact test bank of your textbook, 2) most textbooks teach the same subjects when it comes to the most important knowledges, 3) if you are worry about those test banks don't cover some small test points, writing your own questions usually can't achieve this goal either, because if you want to cover minor test points you will spend A LOT of hours to write questions, and it will be over 200+ questions per chapter, trust me I have done that for my neuroscience course, 100 questions like shown in this video in any biology courses can only cover the most important points, which is equivalent as the any test banks.\nYou can even get two different test banks from two different textbooks in your subject. Then use one to test yourself after a week to see which knowledges are your weak points, and put those weak points in Anki or use mnemonic devices (much faster and much much better than Anki) such as Method of Loci, to memorize them. Then before the exam, use another test banks to review all knowledges again.\nIf you can get all the main knowledge points right, then you can get 85+, which is an A in many schools. But if you want a 4.0 GPA (90+ or A+), then you will have to spend much more time on the minor knowledge points. But usually this kind of efforts will also hinder your chances to develop other strengths, such as research or clinical experience. This is what I'm struggling with because I'm a perfectionist.\n\nAnother better way to do this is to write down knowledge points using keywords in a structured way as the textbook unfold, not flat questions as what this video has shown. Then color code the ones you don't know. Usually textbooks are organized in a way that's optimized for you to learn. Psychology research has shown that to store information in our long-term memory requires meaningful organization of the information. So write down knowledge keywords in an structured way help you memorize the relationship and organize the information. When you recall it, you can treat these keywords as questions too."", ""You know, this is even more stupid than to ask how to study, but I have heard of active recall so many times and I have never tried out of laziness (or honestly, not knowing how to implement it). I really liked this method, just questions. I'll will definitely try this""]"

The Basic Kindle is lighter and smaller hardware-wise, but the screen size is the same with the paperwhite. It doesn't make sense why the paperwhite is bigger if its screen isn't. True, the screen res of the basic is lower, however, it's not really that big of a deal. There are times when you can hardly notice any difference. I noticed that the paperwhite takes a while to turn certain pages due mostly to the higher res.

They often explain very bad, give taunting comments such as ""don\'t think you clever for answering"" and apply way to much pressure on students, almost to a point of completely giving up. Because of their bad tutoring, I did poorly on my first maths test (maths was my favourite subject in 9th grade). Therefore, I studied harder for the next test. However, because of the pressure in this school, I have developed a terrible stress anxiety. I had no problems taking test before but now I shake badly during test, almost tear up and my mind goes blank. This has never happened to me before and the grades, bad teacher and pressure have caused me to fall into a state of depression.

1dIU1YhZX94,"['1. Suicide is a kind of murder.\nSuicide is the same sin as murder. And murder is a violation of the sixth commandment: ""Thou shalt not kill"" (Exodus 20:13). The only differenc that the murderer kills another person, and the suicide kills himself.\nIt is said about murder: ""Whoever sheds human blood, his blood will be shed by the hand of man: for man is created in the image of God"" (Genesis 9:6).\n2. Suicide is a game of God.\nA man who commits suicide rejects the power of God over himself and takes on the role of judge and master of his life.\n3. Suicide is a rebellion against the Creator.\n• God created man for life. A person deprives himself of life, which is a rebellion against the Creator who gave him life.\n• God has plans for each of us (Jeremiah 29:11 ""For only I know the intentions I have for you, says the Lord, intentions for good, and not for evil, to give you future and hope""). Ending his life by suicide, a person crosses out all God\'s plans.\n• God wants us to have eternal life. Suicide crosses out God\'s plan of salvation and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross for our sins (Romans 6:23 ""For the wages of sin is death, and the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"")\n4. Suicide is a product of Satan\'s ""following"" :\nJohn 10:10 and\n\'A thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy.""\nJohn 8:44 ""Your father is the devil; and you want to fulfill your father\'s lusts.\nHe was a murderer from the beginning and did not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.\'\n5. Jesus did not come to take, but to give us life:\nJohn 10:10b ""I have come to have life and to have in abundance.""\n6. Our life belongs to God.\nNo one has the right to deprive himself or someone else\'s life:\n1 Corinthians 6:19-20 ""Do you not know that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit dwelling in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? Because you are bought at a high price.""\n7. The Bible calls suicide evil against yourself:\nActs 16:25-34 ""Around midnight, Paul and Silas, praying, sang to God; and the prisoners listened to them. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundation of the prison was shaken; immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all were loosened. The prison guard, waking up ana seeing that the doors of the prison were open, drew his sword and wanted to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had fled. But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying,\n""Do not do yourself any harm, for we are all here."" He\ndemanded fire, ran into the prison and fell in trembling to Paul and Silas, and having brought them out, he said, ""My lords! what should I do to save myself? And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and all your house will be saved. And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And having taken them at that hour of the night, he washed their wounds and immediately was baptized himself and all his household.

However, I'm not allowed to perform any medical tasks or ask for private information from patients"", ""I really appreciate your reflections toward the end of the video. I am based in the U.S. and I'm wondering why the system is so that is 4 years of undergrad and then 4 years of medical school here? I think it would be beneficial to provide an option for U.S. students to enter medical school as part of a 6 year program after high school.\xa0\n\nI volunteered in a hospital before uni. The most meaningful part of that experience was relating to the patients. My duty consisted mainly of transporting patients to and from their rooms for cardiology services. Years after uni (I studied something other than medicine in uni) I decided I wanted to consider medical school again. However, that wasn't my primary motivation. I wanted to find a job that would give me flexibility to purse something I'm truly  passionate about while also opening an avenue to build clinical work experience in case I wanted to pursue medicine.\n\n I was accepted into a program working in a clinic where they would train me as a technician and medical scribe. It sounded ideal from the outside. I would work 4 days a week, 12 hour days. Most students accepted into the program had a background in emergency medicine (firefighters, nursing students, phlebotomists, paramedics). I was the odd ball. The program was geared to look very good as experience for applying to medical school or physician assistant school (which appears to be a growing trend here in the U.S.). The program was very intense. To say that in 3 weeks I was drawing blood and putting in IVs on real patients without prior experience before the program! Even though I did it and the very qualified trainers had full confidence I could graduate from the program, the amount of anxiety and stress turned out not to be worth the price I was paying psycho-physiologically. If I wanted to pursue medicine I would have to go through it, but I realized I didn't wanted medicine that bad to undergo the kind of sacrifice on my own health the program required. I witnessed how many co-workers had very poor health, were overworked, sleep deprived, and smoked or drank to cope.\n\nIn principle, working in an urgent care (emergency medicine backbone) setting, reminded me of working in a kitchen or fast food restaurant. Although it was efficient and got patients in and out, it was focused on popping patients out with a prescription. Although I see a place for emergency medicine and prescriptions, the medicine I was drawn to, the one that attracted me years before in my volunteering days as a teenager was the relational side of the business. At the urgent care, I enjoyed the patient consultations, running the tests on the high tech machines, and actually trying to find the root cause of the problem.\xa0That's when I realized I was practicing on the wrong side of medicine. I really enjoyed working with very smart, quirky, focused, and passionate people on very hard problems and feeling the spirit of collaboration and teamwork. The serious nature of the work really pulled in a quality of human being who inspired me to pursue hard things that are worthwhile.\n\nI'll always remember that time when the president and chief medical officer came to welcome our humble class of seven during our training. He was a military veteran who recounted how the military places such great responsibility and accountability on young men and women entering the military at 17. In his experience the best of a person is brought out when faced with greater responsibility and accountability. I agree. He figured if the U.S. gives that level of trust and mentorship to up-and-coming soldiers, the same could be done in the health care setting to up-and-coming medical professionals. He said all worthwhile things worth pursuing are hard. This is something I recall on occasion when I am pursuing worthwhile things beyond medicine."", 'This man washes away any nerves I have like a hose on a dirty car', 'I like your video.. so many useful information x) I have a question, do you think doing an internship in an occupational therapy for 1 month abroad in a developing country to help others can be relevant for med school application?', ""For me, work experience exposed some of the issues within the medical industry and also gave me the opportunity to ask medical professionals a whole bunch of questions about the challenges and lifestyle impacts of the career. The issues exposed primarily relates to doctors who run their practise as a business, and those who are acutely aware of the social prestige - by carrying themselves with such superiority they negatively impact other members of staff by maker them feel lesser. The challenges faced by medical professionals often related to chronic and untreatable patients who made them feel powerless in the face of suffering, being overworked and burnt out, and struggling to have a family without sacrificing their career. By observing surgeries and consults from within the room, it gave me an understanding of the reality of the job - standing for hours for surgery, sitting for hours for consult after consult, the smell of surgery (I wasn't prepared for that one), the repetitiveness of specialist consults. These relatively minor cons of a career in medicine were useful to be aware of before entering the degree."", ""I enjoyed both volunteering and working as a care assistant in a dementia care home, and as a healthcare assistant in the Neuro ICU and witnessing surgeries. But to be honest for me it was a bit different. What I am most grateful for is that my work experience as a whole was like a learning curve for me and it helped me in my day to day life with my confidence, for example. \n\nI already had a background in neuroscience when I started to 'tick my work experience list'' and have taken part in some studies about dementia so I was familiar with the signs of dementia and the pathological basis of Alzheimer's Parkinson's etc but never interacted with a patient in real life before. So on my first day as a carer in a dementia care home, I started crying because I was overwhelmed with how much suffering it can be in such a place. I was also very distressed because I didn't know how to interact with such patients, so felt that I was causing them more harm than good because, for example, I didn't know how to ask questions in the right way. Sometimes with these patients, you kinda know you are not going to get an answer back even though they might understand you. So I felt that I was putting them on great distress and sort of reminding them that they can not speak or move. But I learnt to do that and everything changed when I became to feel useful. \n\nBut this was helpful for another reason. It helped in my next job more than I thought, which was in a Neurological Intensive Care Unit. I used to be a very ''weak'' person in the sense that I was fainting every time I was seeing a person having a seizure or having a painful injury. So obviously I wasn't going to be any good to a patient if I was fainting. But because I become used, sort of speak, with a degree of patient suffering, I found it easier to adapt to see patients having awful injuries coming straight away from ED or surgical theatres (for the record, I almost fainted when seeing patient intubation).\n\nBut this prepared me for the next step which was to witness a cardiac surgery and bypass (basically I witnessed a patient being cut in half with the surgeons digging inside his body and try to lift the heart and put some ''tissues'' inside him to deal with the bleeding. My family couldn't believe that I was able to see this after always telling me I can't be a doctor because I am too soft.\n\nSo for me, my work experience did help me to grow as a person and gain a lot more confidence in myself but I appreciate volunteering just as much but for different reasons."", 'What if you didnt get the opportunity of getting work experiance but have done volunteer works can I still apply to med school', ""I sort of agree with you on the expectation of applicants to do hospital work experience and have moments of clarity that suddenly lead them to wanting to become a Dr. I can attest to spending 2 weeks on a ward following FY Doctors around when I was 16 being pretty much useless in terms of fully understanding the role and expectations of Doctors; is it an age thing? However, as a grad I've been working in a hospital for 3 years now in a HCA and more developed role where I've been able to work alongside Drs, Nurses and other Healthcare Professionals and I can tell you I've learnt an incredible amount and definitely feel more informed about my decision to pursue a place on a grad entry course. I don't really think I could take as much of an insight and relevant experience if I was volunteering in a different area as my paid role has allowed me to really get stuck in and develop skills and confidence in speaking to patients and contributing to their care rather than spending a small amount of time with patients on a semi-regular basis.
